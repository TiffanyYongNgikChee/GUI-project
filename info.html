						<hr>
						<p class="event_details">The majority of the first half of Hamilton is centred around the American Revolutionary War, which ran from 1775 until 1783 and saw Britain’s 13 US colonies declare independence from the nation. Although the war ended over 200 years ago, parallels are drawn between the world of then and today.</p>
						<p class="event_details">One hugely memorable example comes in the opening of Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down), where Hamilton converses with fellow military officer Marquis de Lafayette. “We’re finally on the field, we’ve had quite a run”, with his compatriot and fellow US migrant joining him in declaring, “immigrants, we get the job done”. The moment is rightfully greeted by loud applause and cheers from the audience.</p>
						<p class="event_details">It underpins this powerful tale with top class technical prowess, from its lighting and costume to its unparalleled choreography and emotionally charged music, spectacularly cementing its place in the upper echelons of musical history.</p>
